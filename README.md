# Akamai CLI
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/akamai/cli)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/akamai/cli) [![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fakamai%2Fcli.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fakamai%2Fcli?ref=badge_shield)


Akamai CLI is an ever-growing CLI toolkit that lets you configure Akamai platform and products directly from the command line. You can install ready-to-use product packages or build your own custom solutions to manage from the CLI.

### Benefits

- Simple and task-oriented interface
- Consistent user experience across all Akamai products
- Wide range of supported packages and capabilities
- Ability to extend or build your own CLI packages with the supported programming languages, including Go, Python, and JavaScript

### Available Packages

Browse the list of available packages [here](https://developer.akamai.com/cli).

## Install Akamai CLI

Akamai CLI doesn't have any dependencies and is quick to install. However, you may need additional runtime for the packages as they can be based on different programming languages.

Install Akamai CLI by downloading an applicable [release binary](https://github.com/akamai/cli/releases). Follow the detailed instructions for various operating systems below.

You can also use [Homebrew](#install-with-homebrew), [Docker](#install-with-docker) or compile from [source](#compile-from-source).

### Install from binaries

#### Linux and macOS

Once you download the appropriate binary for your system, make it executable, and optionally move it to `$PATH`. Run the following commands:

```bash
$ chmod +x ~/Downloads/akamai-<VERSION>-<PLATFORM>
$ mv ~/Downloads/akamai-<VERSION>-<PLATFORM> /usr/local/bin/akamai
```

#### Windows

Once you download the appropriate binary for your system, simply execute the binary from the command line.

### Install with Homebrew

You can also install Akamai CLI using the Homebrew package manager. If you havenâ€™t used it before, check [Homebrew documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) for system requirements and installation guide.

Once set up, simply run:

```sh
$ brew install akamai
```

This command compiles and globally installs the binary with all necessary dependencies.

### Install with Docker

A container with Akamai CLI and pre-installed public packages is also available in [Docker](http://docker.com). To start, run the following command:

```sh
$ docker run -ti -v $HOME/.edgerc:/root/.edgerc akamaiopen/cli [arguments]
```

> **Note:** This mounts your local `$HOME/.edgerc`, and `$HOME/.akamai-cli-docker` into the container. To change the local path, modify the `-v` arguments.

If you want to transparently use docker when calling the `akamai` command, add the following code block to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` files:

```sh
function akamai {
    if [[ `docker ps | grep akamai-cli$ | wc -l` -eq 1 ]]; then
        docker exec -it akamai-cli akamai $@;
    elif docker start akamai-cli > /dev/null 2>&1 && sleep 3 && docker exec -it akamai-cli akamai $@; then
        return 0;
    else
        echo "Creating new docker container"
        mkdir -p $HOME/.akamai-cli-docker
        docker create -it -v $HOME/.edgerc:/root/.edgerc -v $HOME/.akamai-cli-docker:/cli --name akamai-cli akamai/cli > /dev/null 2>&1 && akamai $@;
    fi;
}
```

You can then run `akamai [arguments]` command and it automatically creates or re-uses a "persistent" container.

Docker containers are ephemeral and run for as long as the command (PID 1) inside them stays running. To let you re-use the same container, Akamai uses `akamai --daemon` command that runs indefinitely inside the container.

To restart the container created by the function above, you can safely run `docker stop akamai-cli` followed by `docker start akamai-cli`.

The script above persists your Akamai CLI installation with configuration and packages in the `$HOME/.akamai-cli-docker` directory.

### Compile from Source

**Prerequisite:** Make sure you install Go 1.7 or later, and the [Glide](https://glide.sh) package manager.

To compile Akamai CLI from source:

1. Change the working directory:
   `cd $GOPATH`
2. Fetch the package:  
    `git clone github.com/akamai/cli`
3.  Go to the package directory:  
    `cd cli`
4. Compile the binary:  

  - For Linux/macOS/*nix, run: `go build -o cli/main.go`
  - For Windows, run: `go build -o akamai.exe cli/main.go`

5. Move the binary (`akamai` or `akamai.exe`) in to your `$PATH`.


## Upgrade to a newer version

Unless you installed Akamai CLI with Homebrew, you can enable automatic check for updates when you run Akamai CLI v0.3.0 or later for the first time.

If a new version is available, CLI prompts you to download it. After the update, your original command is executed using the new version.

For information on manual upgrade and the supported Homebrew command, see `akamai upgrade`.

## How to use Akamai CLI

All CLI commands start with the `akamai` binary, followed by a `command`, and optionally an action or other arguments.

```sh
akamai [command] [action] [arguments...]
```

### Built-in commands

Use the following commands to manage the packages and the toolkit itself:

- `help`

    `akamai help` shows basic usage info, and available commands. To learn more about a specific command, run `akamai help <command> [sub-command]`.

- `list`

    `akamai list` shows you a list of available commands. If a command doesn't display, ensure the binary is executable, and in your `$PATH`.

- `install`

    The `install` command lets you install new packages from a git repository.

    `akamai install <package name or repository URL>` downloads and installs the command repository to the `$HOME/.akamai-cli` directory.

    For Github repositories, specify `user/repo` or `organization/repo`. For official Akamai packages, you can omit the `akamai/cli-` prefix, so to install `akamai/cli-property` it's enough to run `property`.

    The following example installs Akamai CLI for Property Manager from Github using various aliases:

    ```sh
    akamai install property
    akamai install akamai/cli-property
    akamai install https://github.com/akamai/cli-property.git
    ```

    You can specify multiple packages to install at once.

- `uninstall`

    To remove all the package files you installed with `akamai install`, run `akamai uninstall <command>`, where `<command>` is any command within that package.

    You can specify multiple packages to uninstall at once.

- `update`

    To update a package you installed with `akamai install`, run `akamai update <command>`, where `<command>` is any command within that package.

    You can specify multiple packages to update at once.

    If you don't specify additional arguments, `akamai update` updates _all_ packages installed with `akamai install`

- `upgrade`

    Manually upgrade Akamai CLI to the latest version.

    If you installed Akamai CLI with Homebrew, run this command instead:

    ```sh
    $ brew upgrade akamai
    ```

- `search`

    Search all the packages published on developer.akamai.com for the submitter string. Search is performed against the package name, alias, and description. You can find the search results in the console output.

- `config`

    View or modify the configuration settings that drive the common CLI behavior. Akamai CLI maintains a local config in a file in its root directory. The config command supports the following sub-commands:
    - `get`
    - `set`
    - `list`
    - `unset`
    - `rm`


### Installed commands

This type of commands depends on the packages you installed. To use an installed command, run `akamai <command> <action> [arguments]`, e.g.

```sh
akamai property create example.org
```
For the list of supported commands, see the [documentation](https://developer.akamai.com/cli-packages) for your package.

### Custom commands

Akamai CLI provides a framework for writing custom CLI commands. See extended [Akamai CLI documentation](https://developer.akamai.com/cli) to learn how to contribute, create custom packages and build commands.

Before you start building your own commands, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

1. The package must be available through a Git repository that supports standard SSH public key authentication.
2. The executable must be named `akamai-<command>` or `akamai<Command>`
3. Verify that `akamai-command help` works for you. Ideally, CLI should allow for `akamai-command help <sub-command>`
4. If you're using OPEN APIs, the executable must support the `.edgerc` format, and must support both `--edgerc` and `--section` flags
5. If an action fails to complete, the executable should exit with a non-zero status code (however, `akamai` will only return `0` on success or `1` on failure)

As long as the result is executable, you can use any of the supported languages to build your commands, including **Python, Go,** and **JavaScript**.

### Logging

To see additional log information, prepend `AKAMAI_LOG=<debug-level>` to any CLI command. You can specify one of the following logging levels:

- `fatal`
- `error`
- `warn`
- `info`
- `debug`

For example, to see extra debug information while updating the property package, run:

```sh
AKAMAI_CLI_LOG=debug akamai update property
```

If you want to redirect logs to a file, use the `AKAMAI_CLI_LOG_PATH` environmental variable:

```sh
AKAMAI_CLI_LOG=debug AKAMAI_CLI_LOG_PATH=akamai.log akamai update property
```

## Dependencies

Akamai CLI supports the following package managers that help you automatically install package dependencies:

- Python: `pip` (using `requirements.txt`)
- Go: `go modules`
- JavaScript: `npm` and `yarn`

If you want to use other languages or package managers, make sure you include all dependencies in the package repository.

## Command package metadata

The package you install must include a `cli.json` file. This is where you specify the command language runtime version and define all commands included in package.

### Format

- `requirements`: Specifies the runtime requirements. You may specify a minimum version number or use the `*` wildcard for any version. Possible requirements are:
  - `go`
  - `node`
  - `python`

- `commands`: Lists commands included in the package.
  - `name`: The command name (used as the executable name).
  - `aliases`: An array of aliases that can be used to invoke the command.
  - `version`:Â The command version.
  - `description`: A short description for the command.
  - `bin`: A URL to fetch a binary package from if it cannot be installed from source.

    The `bin` URL may contain the following placeholders:

    - `{{.Version}}`:Â The command version.
    - `{{.Name}}`:Â The command name.
    - `{{.OS}}`: The current operating system, either `windows`, `mac`, or `linux`.
    - `{{.Arch}}`:Â The current OS architecture, either `386` or `amd64`.
    - `{{.BinSuffix}}`: The binary suffix for the current OS: `.exe` for `windows`.

### Example

```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "go": "1.8.0"
  },
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "purge",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "description": "Purge content from the Edge",
      "bin": "https://github.com/akamai/cli-purge/releases/download/{{.Version}}/akamai-{{.Name}}-{{.OS}}{{.Arch}}{{.BinSuffix}}"
    }
  ]
}
```
